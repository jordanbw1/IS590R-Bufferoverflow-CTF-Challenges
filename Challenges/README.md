# Challenge1: Lets take it slow
Your objective is to overwrite the "secret" variable to make the flag print out. 
<br/>

## Hint
Try inputting a large number of characters.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Challenge2: Time to pick up the pace
You need to overwrite the "secret" variable with a specific value to make the flag print out. Think you can handle that? ;)
<br/>

## Hint
Try to overwrite the "secret" variable with hex value: "41424344".

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# Challenge3: Functional Nightmare
You need to write a buffer overflow attack without the handy print command. Think you can do that?
<br/>

## Hint
Notice how the comparison is being done? What would happen if one of the variables were to be larger than the other?
